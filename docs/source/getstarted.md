# Getting Started

Hive Metastore Client depends on **Python 3.7+**.

Python Package Index hosts reference to a pip-installable module of this library, using it is as straightforward as including it on your project's requirements.

```bash
pip install hive-metastore-client
```

Or after listing `hive-metastore-client` in your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
